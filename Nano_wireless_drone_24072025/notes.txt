Power Distribution

Battery → Power Distribution Board (PDB) → ESCs and FC.

Use FC’s 5 V regulator output to power RC Rx, Wi‑Fi, and sensors.

ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)

Connect ESC signal wires to FC PWM outputs. E.g.:

ESC1 → FC PWM1

ESC2 → PWM2

ESC3 → PWM3

ESC4 → PWM4

RC Receiver

Supply with 5 V and ground from FC.

Connect CH1–CH4 PWM out to FC Rx input pins (assign in firmware).

Wi‑Fi Module (e.g. ESP8266/ESP32)

Power with 3.3 V from FC or a dedicated regulator.

Cross TX/RX: Wi‑Fi TX → FC RX, Wi‑Fi RX ← FC TX.

For telemetry over serial or UDP, ensure baud rate matches.

Sensors (Optional)

An MPU6050 IMU or similar connects via I²C (SDA, SCL) to the FC.

Provide 3/5 V and share ground.
